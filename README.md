# House-price-prediction-using-flask
In this project, I developed the predictive power of a model trained on house price data. It deploys with flask API and uses Linear Regression to predict the price value. Deploy Machine Learning Model Using Flask to take a model from python code.

If you want to more clear explonation, see my github [House Price Prediction using Flask for Beginners]

This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. It uses a pre-trained Random Forest model to make predictions. The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
